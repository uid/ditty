### Planned, But Unprioritized

* hide cursor when over the xylophone
* "working" indicator for canvas saves
* "do [action] [count] times", passing the current index into [action]
* favicon
* logo
* tab to go between (empty?) slots
* explicit comment blocks for use in source
* parameter annotations (examples, range, special values)
* be able to make recursive calls by dragging the bubble into itself
* update all patterns when changes are made
* click on canvas should close text box
* Template.cloneWithText -> Template.setText
* style parameter in parameter list without small-caps
* when modifying a pattern used elsewhere, ask whether they want to create a enw pattern instead of modifying the existing one
* Fix erroneous "you are not logged in"
* make passed parameters work when source is expanded
* wrap js functions in try/catch
* save the initial bubble
* don't show inbetweeners that are in a different scope than the one a parameter is being dragged from
* actual modal dialogs for rename, add parameter, remove parameter
* highlight the source of an error (such as 'xxx is required')
