Welcome to Ditty
================

Ditty is a project for the thing where you drag blocks until things come out of the speakers.

* All the things.
* The second time you load the thing, it's the same thing.
* There are multiple things we combine into the one thing.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the thing.
2. Deploy the thing.
3. Open the thing at the thing where you deployed it.
4. Type this:

        def angle_bracket
          (1..10).each do |i|
            i.downto(1) { puts "<<<" * rand(20) }
          end
        end
